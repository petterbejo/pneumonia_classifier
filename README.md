# pneumonia_classifier

A binary image classifier to predict whether the X-ray shows signs of pneumonia. 

Please note that this classifier has been built as side/learning project. It is not in any way intended for medical use. 

## Development plan

I intend to develop the following things in the near future, more or less in the indicated order:

1. Implement early stopping.
3. Build models striving for optimal performance, possibly using transfer learning.
4. Make a method to test the model.
5. Refactor train and val loop methods into one method.
6. Write proper documentation for classes and methods where it is missing.
3. Build a web app, probably built with flask and Docker or similar tools, where a user can upload an X-ray and get a prediction.
